Compatable interface present in java.lang package and it contains only one method that is comparedTo() method.

public int compareTo(Object obj)

example
--------
obj1.compareTo(obj2);

|-> returns +ve if any only id Obj1 has to come before Obj2.
|-> return -ve if Obj1 has to come after Obj2
|-> return 0 if Obj1 and Obj2 are same

comparator
----------
comparator is an interface present in java.util.package. this interface defines the following 2 methods.

1)public int compare(Object1 obj1, Object obj2);

compare method internally calls the compareTo() method analysis.

|-> returns -ve if and only id Obj1 has to come before Obj2.
|-> return +ve if Obj1 has to come after Obj2.
|-> return 0 if Obj1 and Obj2 are same.

2) public Boolean equals(Object obj);
whenever we are implementing comparator interface we have to provide only implementation for compare() method.
implementing equals() method is optional because it is already available from Object class through inheritance
